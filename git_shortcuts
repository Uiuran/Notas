#Managing commits and pulls to different remote repos.
#$git pull follows:
#$git fetch repo.git
# FETCH_HEAD gets reá¹•o.git hash head commit
# $git merge : to merge local changes with your changes
# If happens to be conflict use the following:
# $git diff MERGE_HEAD(or whatever remote HEAD you wanna merge to local such ORIGIN_HEAD) FETCH_HEAD
# git will show the difference conflicting and will pin it in the file, go to the file and solve the conflict
# Do git commit adding the changes in the conflict, git merge and git pull. Then happily git push-ing ...
